# 🎶 Mood Music Player

**Mood Music** is a fun, AI-powered web app that detects your emotions from a selfie and plays a song that matches your vibe. Built for experimentation, learning, and a little bit of mood magic.  

Think of it as your personal **vibe DJ**. 😎

## 💻 How It Works

1. You upload a selfie.  
2. The app analyzes facial expressions using [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js).  
3. Detects your dominant emotion.  
4. Plays a random song from the corresponding mood folder (`happy`, `sad`, `angry`, `neutral`).  
5. You can manage playlists and add more songs directly from the UI.

## ✨ Notes

1. This project was built for fun, Nothing Serious.

2. All songs are played from your local machine — no uploads to the internet.

3. Works best with clear, front-facing selfies.
